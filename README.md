# dotfiles - Configuration as Code

My dotfiles to help me setup my machine in minutes using [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

There is also an [article](https://sspai.com/post/66894) in Chinese explained why and how to use it.

## Rules

- Automate everything, configuration as code.
- Prefer to `nix` whenever possible.
  - `yay` or `brew` only for OS specific packages.
  - Migrate to home-manager.

Happy hacking!
